**Phishing Email Detection Using BERT-Based Models**

Overview

This project focuses on detecting phishing emails using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging BERT-based models such as TinyBERT and DistilBERT, this project aims to provide a robust solution for identifying phishing attempts in email communications. Model compression techniques are also employed to optimize the performance and efficiency of the detection system.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled emails, categorized into phishing and non-phishing. The EDA file provides insights into data distribution, feature correlations, and preprocessing steps.
